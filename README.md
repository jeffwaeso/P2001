# P2001
Ptototypical Project 2001
This project is created from the savnw.sav case in the Example folder of the PTI PSSE software.  

************************************************************************************************
This is to test Project structure such that each Repository represent 1 Project.
Inside each Project Repository there can be multiple Energizations.

Questions: 
- Should we put Energizations into subfolders?
- Should we put Stages into subfolders?
- How should we define Branch and Tag in this case?
